# Local Binary Pattern
this code (LBP.py) extract local binary pattern (LBP) of image using multiprocessing to reduce execution time  
It reduce execution time from about 400 msec to about 150 mses with P=8 and from about 200 msec to about 80 msec with P=4  
Slow yet :///  
I'm tryin to speed that up ;)
