# Local Binary Pattern
this code (LBP.py) extract local binary pattern (LBP) of image using multiprocessing to reduce execution time  
In addition we break image into sub images and calculate weight for each one. if weight of sub image be more than a threshold (hear average of total weights), lbp histogram is calculated for that sub image. thus we reduce execution time by calculate histogram just for regions with more informations.
